SimplePong2D
============

Simple 2D Pong Game using the OpenGL Pipeling 3.0, no user input, only Two AI's Duking it out.

This project was a Homework in OpenGL, to learn the OpenGL Pipeline and OpenGL Shader Language. Thus There is no User input
and The two AIs are very simple. It is not synced with a clock so it may run a little fast...
